Arduino-MO

My replica of the friendly cleaner bot "M-O" from the film "Wall-e" is currently envisioned as being 3D printed and driven by 3 Arduino Mega processors.

Mega-1 will be the main controller, taking in commands from IR and Bluetooth remotes, controlling animation servos, and issuing state commands to the other two Arduino Megas over i2c.

Mega-2 will handle sound playback and an LED matrix for his eyes.

Mega-3 will control a Ball-Balancing Robot (BBR) that is the base of the bot, and providing bot mobility.
